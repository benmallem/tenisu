This project is about creating an api REST using Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf.
- /: renders html template displaying information about the api
- /players: returns list of players ordered by rank
- /players/id: returns player with a specific id 
- /statistics: returns players statistics

I deployed it using Render: https://tenisu-0rgr.onrender.com/
